"""
Tensor Network Module for Quantum Digital Twins

This module implements tensor network representations for quantum digital twins,
targeting CERN-level fidelity benchmarks (99.9%) through sophisticated
mathematical frameworks.

Key Components:
- Matrix Product Operators (MPO) for quantum system representation
- Tensor network simulation with high fidelity
- Fidelity optimization algorithms
- Integration with existing quantum digital twin architecture
