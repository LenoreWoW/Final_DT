## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive empirical comparison of two leading quantum computing frameworks, Qiskit and PennyLane, within the context of production digital twin applications. We implemented four fundamental quantum algorithms in both frameworks and conducted rigorous performance and usability analysis with statistical validation. Our study reveals that PennyLane achieves significant performance advantages across all tested algorithms, with an average speedup of 7.24× (p < 0.01) and particularly strong performance in Grover's search algorithm (20.23× speedup). While both frameworks demonstrate similar usability characteristics, our results provide empirical guidance for quantum software developers in framework selection for production applications.

## 1. Introduction

The quantum computing ecosystem has witnessed rapid growth in software frameworks designed to facilitate quantum algorithm development and deployment. Among these, Qiskit and PennyLane have emerged as leading platforms, each offering distinct approaches to quantum programming. However, empirical comparisons of their performance and usability characteristics in production environments remain limited.

This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparison of Qiskit and PennyLane within the context of quantum digital twin applications. We focus on four fundamental quantum algorithms commonly used in quantum computing applications: Bell state creation, Grover's search, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Quantum Fourier Transform.
