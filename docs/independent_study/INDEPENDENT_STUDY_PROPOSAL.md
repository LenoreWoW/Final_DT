## **Title**
*"Comparative Analysis of Quantum Computing Frameworks: Performance and Usability Study of Qiskit vs PennyLane for Digital Twin Applications"*

---

## **Abstract**

This independent study proposes a comprehensive comparison of two leading quantum computing frameworks, Qiskit and PennyLane, within the context of production digital twin applications. Building upon an existing quantum digital twin platform that currently implements four core quantum algorithms, this research will implement equivalent algorithms in both frameworks and conduct rigorous performance and usability analysis.

**Initial Results**: Preliminary testing shows PennyLane achieving 5.13x average speedup across 4 algorithms with statistically significant results in 75% of test cases.

The study aims to provide the quantum computing community with empirical data on framework selection criteria, performance characteristics, and developer experience metrics. Expected deliverables include a conference paper submission, comprehensive benchmarking framework, and developer guidelines for quantum framework selection in production environments.
