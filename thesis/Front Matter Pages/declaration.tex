I, Hassan Abdulhadi Al-Sahli, declare that this thesis titled ``A Conversational Quantum-Powered Framework for Universal Digital Twin Generation'' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that this work was done wholly while in candidature for a Master of Science degree at Hamad Bin Khalifa University.

Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed. Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.

No part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at Hamad Bin Khalifa University or any other institution.
