## Overall Project Overview

The project aims to build a robust, real‑time digital twin prototype initially focused on athletic training and extendable to military simulations. The system is designed to be modular and scalable so that, in the future, individual components can be enhanced with quantum algorithms and later integrated with holographic visualization systems (Phase 3). For now, Phases 1 and 2 must be completed within 15 weeks.
