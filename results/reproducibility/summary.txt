REPRODUCIBILITY VALIDATION SUMMARY
=================================

Validation completed at: 2025-04-19 23:54:20
Total execution time: 2.50 seconds

Monte Carlo Reproducibility:
---------------------------
Coefficient of Variation (CV) of mean:
  Quantum: 4.19%
  Classical: 1.44%

Maximum deviation from mean:
  Quantum: 0.025697
  Classical: 0.009225

Quantum is Less reproducible than classical (ratio: 2.90)

Quantum Machine Learning Reproducibility:
---------------------------------------
CV of MSE: 32.96%
CV of RÂ²: 10.01%

Overall Assessment:
------------------
- Quantum Monte Carlo shows LOWER reproducibility than classical methods
- Quantum ML shows LOW reproducibility (CV >= 20%)
